# FlutterFusion

A starter project to begin any new flutter project.
It has the `GetX` package and some more custom helpers and packages to help the dev to build their apps with ease.
It uses the `MVC` pattern which is one of the best pattern among developers.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thedevsbuddy/flutter_fusion.git my_awesome_project
```

**Note:- Know about the _[ThemeBuilder\*](#theme-builder)_**

### Features

Here are some awesome features which you will get by default when scaffolding your project with this starting project.

- **MVCs Pattern**: We are using `MVC` pattern to manage whole project easily as it separates the Logic and UI and models. But i added new layer as Service which will help us communicate with APIs.
- **Modular Structure**: Most of the developers are the fan of Modular Structure as it gives the flexibility to use a module on any project we build.
- **Module Generator Tool**: I have built a simple module generator tool to help you generate any module with just a single command.
- **Mock-Able Services**: Sometimes we don't have any api to test and build our apps so we need to do some mockups for apps here we cover that as well.

## New features

#### Modulr Package - Generate modules in the project

This package is added as a helper toolkit to generate the module in the project with just a command
line.

## Modulr

Modulr is a code generator tool specially created for `FlutterFusion` starter kit, This helps you to generate all the files required for a Module.

### Usage of Modulr

Below is the example of how you can use this package and provided commands

1. `modulr:generate`: This is generates whole code for a module.
2. `modulr:controller`: This command generates a Controller file inside the provided module.
3. `modulr:page`: This command generates a Page/View file inside the provided module.

### Generate Module

```shell
dart pub run modulr:generate Blog
```

This will generate all the files required for a `Module`

#### Generated Files Inside your project's `lib/app/modules` directory.

```txt
ðŸ“‚ blog
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ controllers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_controller.dart
